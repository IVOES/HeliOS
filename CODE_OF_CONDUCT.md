# Code of Conduct

The HeliOS Project has a very simple Code of Conduct. If you are unable to follow the Code of Conduct, you will be blocked from the HeliOS Project's GitHub organization and its repositories indefinitely.

1. Adhere to the [GitHub Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service)
2. Treat others as you wish to be treated yourself (i.e., act as if you are a mature adult human being by treating others with respect and dignity)

If you observe someone who is unable to follow the Code of Conduct or generally acting like an idiot, please contact us at **conduct@heliosproj.org**.
