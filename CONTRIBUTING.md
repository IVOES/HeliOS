# Contributing to HeliOS
We love that you are interested in joining the HeliOS Project community as a contributor. We want to make contributing to the project as easy and seamless as possible, whether it is:

- Proposing new features
- Submitting a new feature
- Improving documentation
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
The HeliOS Project uses GitHub exclusively to maintain and develop HeliOS. The best methods for engaging with the HeliOS Project is through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

Submit a:
- **Issue**: If you are reporting a bug, asking a question or proposing a new feature, then submit an issue. Please do not submit source code or other file changes through an issue. If you do, you will be asked to submit a pull request and your issue will be closed. See the **Submitting an Issue** section below for more details on submitting an issue.
- **Pull Request**: If you are submitting a bug fix, a new feature or a documentation change, then submit a pull request. See the **Submitting a Pull Request** section below for more details.

## Submitting an Issue

If you are reporting a bug then submit a **Bug Report** issue. If you are in need of help or seeking support then submit a **Support Request**. Anything else should be submitted as an **Other Request**. To open a new issue, go [here](https://github.com/heliosproj/HeliOS/issues). We kindly ask for your patience as it may take several days before we are able to respond to your issue. If it is a bug report or support request, it may take longer.

## Submitting a Pull Request

First and foremost, it may take a week or more before your pull request is merged (if it is merged at all). All pull requests are reviewed multiple times and we may request you make changes before your pull request is merged. Once your pull request is merged, it will not appear in the mainline HeliOS source code until the next release which may be several months away. To submit a pull request, the following steps **must** be followed:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from ``develop``. **Pull requests forked from the ``master`` branch will be rejected.**
2. If you have added a new feature, you **must** add unit tests for the new feature. Pull requests for new features not accompanied by unit tests will be rejected.
3. Your code changes must include code comments (where appropriate) and be accompanied by documentation updates (again, where appropriate). Most documentation changes are made to the doxygen documentation in HeliOS.h.
4. Ensure all unit tests pass.
5. Format your code using Uncrustify. The HeliOS Uncrustify config is available [here](/extras/uncrustify/helios.cfg).
6. Issue that pull request and hang tight! :)
